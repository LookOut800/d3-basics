# d-3 basics, a starter app for a visual challenge

Hi, and thanks for checking out my visual basics app!

This app uses the Angular JS, D3js, and topoJson libraries to build several dynamic data visualizations.
The first Visual is build by querying a dataset from data.cityofboston.gov with information about Urban Gardens and Orchards in Boston. Hopefully you can now find a greenspace in boston near you !

The second and third visualizations are representations of Liquor Licenses issued in the city of Boston over the last 9 years.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
